## FFmpeg Notice
The standalone executable built by `build.py` and `transcode.spec` bundles
unmodified FFmpeg and ffprobe binaries. Depending on the target platform, the
binaries are obtained from:

- macOS: evermeet.cx FFmpeg distributions – <https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg>
- Linux: johnvansickle.com static builds – <https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/>

Each distribution above provides the corresponding FFmpeg source code through
the same download pages. The upstream GPL terms for FFmpeg therefore apply to
the bundled binaries. No additional modifications are made to FFmpeg in this
project.
